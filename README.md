Distributed Chat System - Performance ClientProject OverviewThis project is a multithreaded Java WebSocket client designed to stress-test a distributed chat server deployed on AWS EC2 (t2.micro). The client evaluates system stability, throughput, and latency under varying concurrency levels, specifically focusing on the challenges of WebSocket broadcasting on single-core cloud instances.Key FeaturesRate Limiting: Implemented Thread.sleep(10) to ensure 100% message delivery success and prevent server-side buffer overflow.Connection Staggering: Introduced a 200ms delay between thread startups to mitigate CPU spikes during the WebSocket handshake phase.Decoupled Architecture: Utilized a Producer-Consumer pattern with LinkedBlockingQueue for efficient message handling.Data Collection: Comprehensive logging of timestamps, latencies, and success status to metrics.csv.PrerequisitesJava: JDK 17 or higher.Maven: For dependency management and building.Python 3: For running the performance analysis scripts (requires pandas and matplotlib).Getting Started1. Build the ProjectNavigate to the project root and run:Bashmvn clean install
2. Run the ClientTo execute the load test with 32 threads (Optimal Point):Bashjava -cp target/client-part2-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar cs6650.assignment.chatclient.SimpleWebSocketClient
Note: Ensure the server IP in SimpleWebSocketClient.java is updated to your current EC2 Public IPv4 address (e.g., 54.146.230.194).3. Generate Performance ChartsAfter the test completes and results/metrics.csv is generated, run the analysis script:Bashpython3 analyze_metrics.py
Performance Results (32 Threads)The following results demonstrate the system's "Optimal Point" stability:MetricValueSuccess Rate100%Peak Throughput~49,850 msg/sP99 Latency0.22 msThroughput StabilityThe chart below shows a steady-state throughput of ~2,750 msg/s (aggregated in 10-second buckets), confirming the effectiveness of the throttling strategy.
